## Northern Trail Outfitters Sample App

This is an adaptation of the original Northern Trail Outfitters Sample App.  Read [this blog post](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2017/07/northern-trail-outfitters-new-sample-application-lightning-components-platform-events-salesforce-dx.html) to learn more about the original application.

This adaptation is used as a sample application for a **Salesforce Platform Events** lab exercise.  In short, this version is missing the platform events parts.  Those parts will be constructed as part of the lab.

## Installation Instructions

Follow the lab exercise workbook at <TBD> to install this app, modify the code to define, publish and subscribe to platform events.
    
There is a companion app, **Northern Trail Manufacturing**, deployed on [Heroku](https://dws-nto-manufacturing.herokuapp.com/) that works alongside this app, communicating using Salesforce Platform Events.  The lab exercise workbook includes instructions on how to use the Manufacturing app.
